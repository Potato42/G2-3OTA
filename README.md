# G2-3OTA
Implementation of DozenalFTW's guess 2/3 of the average game using KACPAW


### Game Objectives

1. Each person makes a guess from 0 to 1000. We should have three sliders for each digit so it's harder to visualize the numbers (or even weirder, 10 switches as a binary rep)
    * Possibly, we could allow decimals... not sure
1. After a week, the bot takes all guesses and averages them, then multiples by 2/3
1. Everyone receives a notification of how they did... closest to 2/3 of the average wins
